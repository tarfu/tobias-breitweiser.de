On the 25.07.2017 my Partner _(Daniel)_ went out to summit the Wildspitze in Vent (Ötztal, Austria) over the normal route through Mittelkarjoch. Our base was the https://www.breslauerhuette.at/[Breslauer Hut]. Weather conditions where far from good with -2C to -5C, a chill temperature of -15C, snow, clouds and heavy winds. On the Taschachferner the visibility was partly down to a few meters and no tracks were visible. In this conditions I broke into a not visible crevasse and hit my knee hard a few meters before the end of the glacier. Due to the hurting knee we had to turn back 50 meters of height before the summit.
